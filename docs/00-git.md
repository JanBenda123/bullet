# Git

We use Git to version control our codebase. You can find a lot of tutorials and materials
on Git. We use the feature branch workflow that you can read more about [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

## Setup

[Install Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) and set user specific data:

```shell
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "my.email@example.com"
```

Now clone our repository. Run this command in a folder you want to place the `bullet` project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/naboj-org/bullet.git
```

## GUI

If you are new to Git, it might be preferrable to use a GUI application. You might have Git
GUI built into your IDE. If not, I have heard good things about [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/),
or I personally use [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/).

Now, let's [get the code running](01-install.md).
